# Strategy Layer Agents (Business + Application)

## Overview
The **Strategy Layer** consists of two cooperating agents:
1. **Business Strategist Agent** – Aligns market, financial, and growth objectives.
2. **Application Strategist Agent** – Translates business strategy into technical roadmaps, architecture, and delivery plans.

Together, they bridge the gap between **business vision** and **technical execution**, orchestrating workflows for downstream engineering and content agents.

---

## Goals
- Establish a single source of truth for business and technical strategy.
- Eliminate disconnects between product vision and software delivery.
- Automate planning, validation, and iterative adjustment of both business and technical objectives.
- Coordinate handoffs to engineering and content agents for seamless execution.

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### Business Strategist Agent
- Conduct market and competitor research.
- Develop financial models and budget forecasts.
- Build go-to-market strategies and acquisition funnels.
- Perform risk assessment and mitigation planning.
- Collaborate with Application Strategist for feasibility and resourcing alignment.

### Application Strategist Agent
- Define high-level technical architecture.
- Create phased development roadmaps (MVP → Scale).
- Validate feasibility of proposed business initiatives.
- Coordinate with Frontend, Backend, and Content Creator agents.
- Ensure cost-efficient and scalable technical solutions.
