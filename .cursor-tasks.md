# Project Checklist for Production-Ready Site

Below is a comprehensive checklist organized into major sections covering database setup, API development, UI updates, design refinement, performance, accessibility, analytics, code quality, documentation, and the final build/commit process.

---

## 1. Database Setup & Content Migration

### 1.1 Analyze Marketplace Page
- [x] Inspect the live page and source code to identify all data fields (e.g., title, description, image URL, price, category, etc.).
- [x] Document the current structure and any dynamic elements in a file (e.g., `marketplace_fields.md`).

### 1.2 Analyze Blog Page
- [x] Examine the blog page to list required fields (e.g., title, author, content, published date, image URL, tags, etc.).
- [x] Record findings in a separate document (e.g., `blog_fields.md`).

### 1.3 Design Database Schema
- [x] Based on the analyses, design a relational schema with tables for `MarketplaceItems` and `BlogPosts`.
- [x] Create a diagram (using a tool like dbdiagram.io) outlining fields, data types, constraints, and relationships.

### 1.4 Initialize Prisma
- [x] Install Prisma dependencies (`npm install prisma @prisma/client`).
- [x] Run `npx prisma init` to generate the Prisma folder and configure the database connection in the `.env` file.

### 1.5 Implement Prisma Schema
- [x] Edit `schema.prisma` to define models for `MarketplaceItem` and `BlogPost` with the identified fields.
- [x] Add indexes, constraints, and relations as needed; then validate with `npx prisma validate`.

### 1.6 Migrate Existing Content
- [x] Run a migration command (e.g., `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`) to create the database schema.
- [x] Write a seeding script or manually import existing marketplace and blog content into the database.
- [x] Verify the data with `npx prisma studio`.
